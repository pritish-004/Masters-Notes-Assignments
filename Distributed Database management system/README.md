Distributed Database management system for forest related activities.

Gained practical experience of designing a distributed database. Following are the tasks performed:

● Captured the necessary requirements, prepared detailed Problem description and wrote relevant sample queries and modeled the requirement using the EER conceptual model.

● Derived a set of data dependencies (FD) and normalized the original database schema into 3NF

● Performed primary and derived horizontal and vertical fragmentation and data allocation using BEA algorithm

● proposed a set of indexes, based on final schema, that improve query running time; analysed each proposed index by identifying which queries benefit from these indexes.
