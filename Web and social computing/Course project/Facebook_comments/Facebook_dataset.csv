Yes!,0
My diabetic nurse suggested I get one when I went onto insulin and the metformin and Diamicron.,0
Yes. If you ever have an emergency it is easy for the doctors to tell what issues you have and they can alter IV meds or other treatments based on your diagnosis. As I write this I look down on my wrist and see I forgot mine at home today. LOL,0
I've just come back from docs after newly being 'upgraded' also. Nurse said no because not taking medication. Do you all still think I should then? x,0
ABSOLUTELY!!!  There has been numerous false arrests because policed officers don't know the difference between low BG & someone drinking & driving,0

That's a good question.  I would like to know the answer too. And why would I need to wear one if the answer is yes?,0

No unless you're having constant issues or blacking out,0
I've been type 2 for 5 years but have never been advised by my doctor to wear one.  But if you are experiencing constant highs and lows it might be a good idea.,0

I wore a bracelet and I have a key chain with diabetic driver.  I have a silicone bracelet and I bought them on eBay.  To me it doesn't matter if you insulin dependent or not.  I would rather have people know that I'm a diabetic and not drunk.,0
Talk to your Dr. I don't wear one but I have a tag on my car keys,0
If you are travelling by plane or cruise ship might be good idea.  Or if you do walking tours  or any activity that might take your level to a low level.,0

"I'm a type 1, but that could be because your sugars are high.  I know when I go high, I vision becomes a little blurry, hope this helps :D",0
None,0
Blurred vision for me happens when my sugar fluctuates to much. If it goes to high or to low. The fluid in your eye is sensitive to these changes. The best way to keep it under control is to keep your sugar in tight control. It is very annoying but manage,0
My vision gets blurred when levels high.,0
It's to do with high sugars.  Your body tries to get rid of sugar any way it can and thru the fluid in the eyes is one of them,0

I don't test right now...its out of pure denial that it matters...I know it does but I just don't bother with it,0
I test one -3 times a day...depending on what I have eaten for the day...my MD suggests once a day after work,0
because it motivates one to eat and exercise pro-actively in order to maintain sugar control. sugar high-get out and walk and eat low carb.. sugar low-eat slow burn carb and walk leisurely.,0

I test every morning..Always being aware of my numbers.,0
to keep a track of BGL so as to be best able to respond to unhealthy levels.,0
"every two hours, so that I know what my diet is doin to my sugars",0
Because high blood sugar levels means it is damaging organs like your kidneys and if you don't keep your levels down your kidneys will shut down and you will have to go on dialysis to clean your blood for you. Not a good outcome. So many other dangers too,0

Also, I have high blood pressure as well, but we arenGÇÖt doing anything for that yet. SO here are my questions.

1. Is Type 2 diabetes just the 'fat disease' or is it more?
2. What am I doing wrong? Should I change my diet (And if so, what should I change it to)
3. Should I exercise?
4. Do I need to monitor my sugar
5. What will happen if I just ignore it?""",0

I'm not looking for a pity party by any means. I hate those lol. I just need to vent, I suppose. Has anyone else been this way? I keep trying to figure out why..maybe it's the stress of my husband being away for work, lack of self esteem because I can't get hired anywhere, anger against my former employer and co-workers. I was doing great until a resident doctor lowered my medication and another didn't listen to my request to be put back on the original dosage. But hopefully that will change once I call them this week. I don't know what being depressed feels like..is it just sadness?? Am I feeling depressed? Does diabetes cause it? Can it?

"This was posted to a Type 1 Diabetes group that we follow.  We thought it applied here too:

""When I was diagnosed type one diabetic, 
everyone knew what I was in for but me.
The only life I knew was of an athlete, 
and I lost control over my fuel source.

But what I did next sparked the single 
most proud accomplishment in my life.
I turned to my parents and told them
this is going to fit into my life.
It took seven years, but 
I upheld my promise to both my parents 
and to myself.

I may not have realized it, but 
when I was diagnosed, I was shattered. 
My world fell to pieces but in that process- 
the deepest breakdown of myself I could 
ever experience- I got to know each and 
every piece I was made of.
I found courage, strength and eventually,
self-assurance. I picked up every piece
that I wanted to salvage and I fit them 
back together efficiently. By doing so,
I find I can live effectively.
That is the type of fitness I believe in.

You are made of unique pieces. Get familiar with them.
Primitive Playground is about finding how they 
'fit' together efficiently, in order to live more effectively.

Evolution used to mean only the fit survive,
today it means those who are fit, thrive.""",0
