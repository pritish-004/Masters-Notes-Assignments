1. For the different sized networks that you used for Assignment 1, implement the normalized metrics used to measure centrality of nodes - Degree centrality, Closeness centrality, Betweenness centrality and Eigenvector centrality.  Discuss your observations w.r.t the computed value of the metrics on the perceived importance of nodes in the network and submit a detailed report.

2.  To implement   (i) HITS algorithm   (ii)  PageRank algorithm

	Part (a) : Calculate and compare PageRank and HITS scores for the medium-scale network (number of nodes in tens of thousands) that you used in Assignment 1. 

	Part (b) : Which of the Webpages (assuming the nodes in the dataset to be Webpages) have the highest and lowest PageRank and Hubs-Authorities score? Correlate your observations with reference to the experiments performed in Assignment 1 (w.r.t various network properties) and write a detailed analysis of your observations, along with plots of the rank/score distribution.
