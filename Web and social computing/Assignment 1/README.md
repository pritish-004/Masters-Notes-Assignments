Consider real-world information networks of different scale (atleast 3 different standard datasets with nodes and edges  in the order of millions to hundreds). Design an information network analysis strategy for measuring the various network properties listed below.

1. Degree distribution
2. Diameter
3. Geodesic path length
4. Clustering coefficient & average clustering coefficient
5. Strongly connected components 
6. SCC their properties
7. Sparseness
8. 1-connectedness to k-connectedness; what is k for your graph?

Submit a detailed report on the findings of your analysis, supported by the necessary plots and visualisations. Also comment on the nature of the information graphs that can be potentially verified using formal models.
