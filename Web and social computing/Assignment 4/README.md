Problem Statement: 
Demonstrate the usefulness of all the concepts studied and experimented with in the previous assignments by applying it to large-scale COVID-19 graph data (of India or any other country that is majorly affected; Indian data available for download from https://api.covid19india.org/).

This is an open-ended assignment and the specific perspectives you want to explore and analyze so that you can comment on the value of concepts studied is completely up to you. The assignment will be graded on the creativity shown in analyzing the data, perspectives observed, the effectiveness with which proof is shown to support your theory/observations. You may use visualizations to show your results (for inspiration, visit https://covidgraph.com/)
